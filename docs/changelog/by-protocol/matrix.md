# Matrix Review

**Protocol:** Matrix
**File:** `src/worker/matrix.ts`
**Reviewed:** 2026-02-18

It contained: - Generic Matrix architecture overview (federation, client-server, application services) - Raw HTTP request/response examples for upstream Matrix API calls (not the PortOfCall API)

## Bugs Found and Fixed

No critical or medium severity bugs found during review. Minor improvements and documentation updates applied.

## Documentation Improvements

Full protocol documentation created with endpoint references, wire format specifications, and usage examples.
