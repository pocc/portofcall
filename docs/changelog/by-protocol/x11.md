# X11 Review

**Protocol:** X11
**File:** `src/worker/x11.ts`
**Reviewed:** 2026-02-18

## Summary

`docs/protocols/X11.md` was a pre-implementation planning document titled "X11 Protocol Implementation Plan". It contained a fictional `X11Client` class at a nonexistent path `src/worker/protocols/x11/client.ts` with methods like `createWindow()`, `mapWindow()`, `drawLine()`, `drawRectangle()`, `drawText()` — none of which exist in the actual implementation. It also contained a fictional `X11Client` React component with a canvas element, a WebSocket connection flow, and a "create window" button. The two actual API endpoints (`/api/x11/connect` and `/api/x11/query-tree`) were entirely absent. Replaced with an accurate power-user reference. Key additions: 1. **Two-endpoint structure** — documented `POST /api/x11/connect` (connection probe + setup handshake) and `POST /api/x11/query-tree` (setup + QueryTree + GetProperty for window names) with exact request/response JSON, field defaults, and all response shapes.
