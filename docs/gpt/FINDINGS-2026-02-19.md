# GPT Protocol Review Findings (All Protocols)

Generated: 2026-02-19

## Scope
- Reviewed 238 protocol modules in src/worker/*.ts (excluding helpers index.ts, cloudflare-detector.ts, ssh2-impl.ts).
- Correlated docs/protocols/*.md coverage and API route wiring from src/worker/index.ts.

## High-Confidence Findings
1. Missing protocol docs for implemented modules (7): submission, tcp, tftp, torcontrol, uwsgi, varnish, ymsg.
2. Route wiring gap candidates (0): .
3. Doc/route mismatches requiring manual confirmation: 165 protocol modules.

## Medium-Confidence Findings
1. Modules that open sockets without protocol-local Cloudflare guard (69): activeusers, afp, ami, battlenet, beats, chargen, daytime, dicom, discard, dot, echo, elasticsearch, epmd, epp, etcd, finger, gemini, gopher, h323, hsrp, ident, ike, influxdb, informix, ipp, jabber-component, jsonrpc, l2tp, matrix, mdns, mgcp, mpd, msn, msrp, napster, ninep, nntp, nsca, oscar, portmapper, qotd, radsec, rcon, realaudio, rip, sccp, sentinel, shoutcast, sip, sips, snpp, soap, socks4, spamd, stomp, svn, sybase, syslog, teamspeak, tftp, time, turn, varnish, ventrilo, x11, xmpp-s2s, xmpps2s, ymsg, zabbix.
Note: some routes may rely on Cloudflare platform blocks or higher-level checks, so this is a consistency/security-hardening finding, not always a direct exploit.
2. Modules using setTimeout without clearTimeout in-file (188): 188 modules.
Note: some timeout promises intentionally do not require clearTimeout; manual review is needed for leak/straggler timers.

## Implementation Compatibility Findings
- Modules using Node Buffer APIs under nodejs_compat (17): adb, chargen, cifs, dnp3, git, hsrp, ike, l2tp, mdns, mumble, node-inspector, nrpe, oscar, realaudio, rip, turn, ymsg.
- This is runtime-compatible with current wrangler.toml, but these paths should remain covered by tests in case compatibility flags change.

## Next Manual Review Queue (Priority)
- Protocols missing docs first: submission, tcp, tftp, torcontrol, uwsgi, varnish, ymsg.
- Then review doc/route mismatches and Cloudflare-guard consistency for externally exposed endpoints.
