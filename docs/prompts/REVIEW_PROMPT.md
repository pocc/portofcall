In repo /Users/rj/gd/code/portofcall , please read docs/ . Please find an implemented protocol and review it. Please improve it for a power user who is very familiar with all of the functionality of the protocol. Please add the protocol to node_modules/mutex.md and make sure not to start on a protocol another agent is working on in mutex.md. When you are done, please add what you did to docs/REVIEWED.md
