# 9P (Plan 9 Filesystem Protocol)

## Overview

**9P** is a network protocol developed for Plan 9 from Bell Labs. It presents all system resources as files in a hierarchical filesystem, enabling remote access to files, processes, and devices.

**Port:** 564 (9P), varies
**Transport:** TCP
**Version:** 9P2000

## Protocol Specification

9P is a message-based protocol where everything is a file.

### Message Types

- `Tversion/Rversion` - Protocol version negotiation
- `Tauth/Rauth` - Authentication
- `Tattach/Rattach` - Attach to file tree
- `Twalk/Rwalk` - Walk file tree
- `Topen/Ropen` - Open file
- `Tcreate/Rcreate` - Create file
- `Tread/Rread` - Read file
- `Twrite/Rwrite` - Write file
